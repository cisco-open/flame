Flame is a platform that enables developers to compose and deploy federated learning (FL) training workloads easily.
The system is comprised of a service (control plane ) and a python library (data plane).
The service manages machine learning workloads, while the python library facilitates composition of ML workloads.
And the library is also responsible for executing FL workloads.
With extensibility of its library, Flame can support various experimentations and use cases.
