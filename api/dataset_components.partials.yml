    # realm dictates the boundary where data can be loaded and used for training.
    # It is a pipe-separated (i.e., separated by character |) notation. Its concept is similar
    # to domain name. An empty realm (i.e., "") means that the dataset can be loaded into
    # a compute node anywhere in the world.
    # The realm consists of public boundaries (e.g., us) and private boundaries (e.g., cisco).
    # The public boundaries are pre-populated while the private boundaries can be defined
    # and extended by each private boundary's admin.
    # The public boundaries represent geographical locations whereas the private boundaries
    # represent logical boundaries.
    #
    # The flame system maintain the mapping between the realm and a launcher (a program that
    # helps launching an ML workload in a cluster or machine associated with the launcher).
